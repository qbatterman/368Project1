Click start button located above cards to begin the game.

Card on the left is top of your pile, card of the right is top of dealers.
Deals left to right, doesn't deal dealers second card until you've finished (technically wrong for professional game but it's my version).
Keep hitting until you decide to stay, if you go over 21 you bust.
once you stay dealer will go until value is 17 or greater (standard rule).
If dealer busts or scores lower than you, you win. Tie goes to you.

No money is bet, a score is simply kept on the top instead.
Game goes on forever....  :)
